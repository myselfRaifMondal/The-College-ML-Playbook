# NumPy Basics - Section 1
Welcome to **Section 1: Basics** of the NumPy Learning Repository. In this section, we cover the **foundations of NumPy arrays** - the building blocks of data manipulation in Python and Machine Learning.
---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Create NumPy arrays in different ways.
- Understand array attributes (shape, size, data type).
- Reshape, flatten and transpose arrays.
- Perform indexing and slicing operations.
- Generate arrays using `arange` and `linspace`.
---

## Notes
- NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists.
- Always check `.shape` before applying ML algorithms - most bugs come from mismatched dimensions.
- Boolean indexing is extremely powerful for filtering datasets.
